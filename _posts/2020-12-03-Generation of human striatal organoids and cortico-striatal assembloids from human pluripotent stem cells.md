Cortico-striatal projections are essential for motivated behaviors, and their dysfunction is linked to neuropsychiatric diseases. This study developed a method to generate region-specific brain organoids from human pluripotent stem cells, mimicking the human striatum with electrically active medium spiny neurons. These organoids were combined with cerebral cortical organoids to create 3D cortico-striatal assembloids.  Using viral tracing and functional assays, the assembloids demonstrated axonal projections from cortical to striatal organoids, forming synaptic connections. Medium spiny neurons matured electrophysiologically and showed calcium activity upon optogenetic stimulation. Additionally, assembloids derived from patients with a 22q13.3 deletion revealed calcium activity defects, showcasing this platformâ€™s potential for studying cortico-striatal connectivity and disease mechanisms using patient-derived cells.
