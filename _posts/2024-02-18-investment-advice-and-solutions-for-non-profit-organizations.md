title: Assembloid model to study loop circuits of the human nervous system
description: Neural circuits connecting the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus are fundamental networks for sensorimotor processing and their dysfunction has been consistently implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders1-9. These recursive, loop circuits have been investigated in animal models and by clinical neuroimaging, however, direct functional access to developing human neurons forming these networks has been limited. Here, we use human pluripotent stem cells to reconstruct an in vitro cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit by creating a four-part loop assembloid. More specifically, we generate regionalized neural organoids that resemble the key elements of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit, and functionally integrate them into loop assembloids using custom 3D-printed biocompatible wells. Volumetric and mesoscale calcium imaging, as well as extracellular recordings from individual parts of these assembloids reveal the emergence of synchronized patterns of neuronal activity. In addition, a multiâ€“step rabies retrograde tracing approach demonstrate the formation of neuronal connectivity across the network in loop assembloids. Lastly, we apply this system to study heterozygous loss of ASH1L gene associated with autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome and discover aberrant synchronized activity in disease model assembloids. Taken together, this human multi-cellular platform will facilitate functional investigations of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in the context of early human development and in disease conditions.

When designing your home setup, consider factors such as lighting, ergonomics, and organization. Ensure that your workspace is well-lit with natural or artificial light, as it can significantly impact your mood and energy levels. Invest in an ergonomic chair and adjustable desk to maintain good posture and reduce the risk of strain or discomfort.

## Creating a Productive Routine

The efficiency and productivity of your workflow greatly depend on the setup of your home office. Creating a designated workspace that is separate from the rest of your living area helps establish a clear boundary between work and leisure, enabling you to focus and concentrate on tasks at hand.

Incorporating elements of inspiration and personalization into your home setup can help boost creativity and motivation. Display artwork, photographs, or motivational quotes that resonate with you. Consider adding plants to your workspace, as they not only add visual appeal but also purify the air and create a refreshing atmosphere.

> Home Workspace Inspiration: Designing a Stylish and Functional Setup

A clutter-free environment is essential for maintaining a productive workflow. Keep your workspace organized by utilizing storage solutions such as shelves, drawers, or filing cabinets. Minimize distractions by keeping non-work-related items out of sight and creating a clean, minimalist aesthetic that promotes a sense of calm and focus.
