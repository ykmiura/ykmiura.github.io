title: Assembloid model to study loop circuits of the human nervous system
description: Neural circuits linking the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus are vital for sensorimotor processing and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Direct functional access to developing human neurons in these circuits has been limited. This study reconstructed an in vitro cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit using human pluripotent stem cells to create a four-part loop assembloid with region-specific neural organoids integrated into custom 3D-printed wells.  Functional analyses revealed synchronized neuronal activity and confirmed neuronal connectivity across the circuit. Modeling heterozygous loss of the ASH1L gene, associated with autism and Tourette syndrome, showed aberrant activity in disease-specific assembloids. This platform offers a robust tool for studying human neural circuits and neuropsychiatric conditions.
