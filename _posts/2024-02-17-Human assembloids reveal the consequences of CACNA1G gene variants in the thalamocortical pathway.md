Abnormal thalamocortical crosstalk is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Variants in CACNA1G, which encodes the T-type calcium channel subunit, are associated with conditions like absence seizures, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Using a human assembloid model of the thalamocortical pathway, this study explored the effects of CACNA1G variants.  The M1531V variant, linked to seizures, caused altered T-type currents in thalamic neurons and hyperactivity in thalamic and cortical regions. Conversely, CACNA1G loss, associated with schizophrenia, disrupted thalamocortical connectivity, increased spontaneous thalamic activity, and caused aberrant axonal projections. These findings highlight the value of assembloid systems in understanding genetic risk at cellular and circuit levels.
