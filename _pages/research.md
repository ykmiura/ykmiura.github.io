title: Research
description: My research focuses on uncovering the mechanisms underlying human nervous system development and function, as well as the pathological processes driving neurological disorders. Utilizing advanced stem cell-based technologies, including regionalized neural organoids and assembloids, I recreate complex cellular processes—such as axon projection and synaptic formation—within human neural circuits to investigate their assembly during development and their disruption in disease states. By integrating multidimensional molecular approaches, such as scarless CRISPR gene editing and anatomical-to-functional live-cell imaging, my work aims to elucidate disease-associated abnormalities at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and system-wide levels, offering novel insights into human disease.

## Research Contributions
1. **G Protein Signaling in Neuronal Development**: Yuki's Ph.D. research focused on uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying brain development. Specifically, Yuki elucidated the biochemical and physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator, the Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) ACAP3, which are critical modulators of membrane dynamics in the central nervous system. I demonstrated that Arf GAP ACAP3 positively regulates neurite outgrowth in developing mouse hippocampal neurons through its biochemical GTPase activity targeting Arf6 (Miura and Hongu et al., Biochemical J. 2016). Furthermore, Yuki discovered that the knockdown of ACAP3 significantly increased the levels of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) at the growth cone of developing hippocampal neurons. To further investigate the in vivo role of ACAP3 in mouse corticogenesis, Yuki employed in utero electroporation, revealing its critical involvement in regulating the morphological dynamics of migrating cortical neurons (Miura and Kanaho, Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2017). Together, these results highlight the importance of membrane dynamics-based cellular processes in central nervous system development.

2. **Reverse Bioengineering Human Neural Circuits**: Yuki has pioneered the development of advanced human neural circuit models, providing transformative tools to study human neural development and associated disorders. He developed cortico-striatal assembloids, which faithfully recapitulate the functional connectivity between the developing cerebral cortex and striatum. These assembloids serve as a robust platform for investigating neural circuit formation and disease phenotypes using cells derived from patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (Miura et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2020; Miura et al., Nature Protocols, 2022). Building on this foundation, Yuki introduced thalamo-cortical assembloids, which mimic developing thalamocortical connectivity and unveil cellular phenotypes linked to CACNA1G channelopathies (Kim, Miura, and Li et al., Neuron 2024). Expanding further, Yuki recently constructed multi-region loop assembloids, integrating cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits to study synchronized neural activity and disease-relevant phenotypes in autism and Tourette syndrome models (Miura and Kim et al., bioRxiv 2024). Collectively, these innovative platforms advance our understanding of the assembly and pathology of human neural circuits, paving the way for novel insights into human disease.
