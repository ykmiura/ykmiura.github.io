title: Research
description: My research focuses on uncovering the mechanisms of human nervous system development and functions, as well as the pathological processes underlying neurological disorders. Using advanced stem cell-based technologies, including neural organoids and assembloids, we recreate complex cellular processes, such as axon projection and synaptic formation within human neural circuits, to understand their assembly during development and disruption in disease states. By integrating molecular approaches such as CRISPR gene editing, live-cell imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics, my recent works aim to elucidate disease-associated abnormalities from cellular to system-wide levels.

## Research Contributions
Yuki's research has significantly advanced our understanding of the physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 in central nervous system development, as well as the development of cutting-edge methodologies to model human neural circuits. Key highlights of his contributions include:
1. **Biochemical and Physiological Roles of Arf6 and ACAP3 in Neuronal Development**: Yuki elucidated the mechanisms by which the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 modulate neuronal development, particularly neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration (Miura and Hongu et al., Biochemical Journal, 2016; Miura and Kanaho, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 2017).
2. **Cortico-Striatal Assembloids**: Yuki pioneered the creation of in vitro models that mimic the functional connectivity between the cerebral cortex and striatum, providing a platform to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders. These models demonstrated synaptic connectivity and disease phenotypes using patient-derived cells (Miura et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2020; Miura et al., Nature Protocols, 2022).
3. **Thalamo-cortical Assembloids**: By developing models of thalamo-cortical connectivity, Yuki uncovered cellular phenotypes associated with CACNA1G channelopathies, contributing to our understanding of their role in neuropsychiatric disorders (Kim, Miura, and Li et al., Neuron 2024)
4. **Multi-Region Loop Assembloids**: Constructing cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop models using custom 3D-printed wells, allowing the study of synchronized neural activity and disease phenotypes (Miura and Kim et al., bioRxiv 2024).
