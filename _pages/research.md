title: Research
description: My research focuses on uncovering the mechanisms underlying human nervous system development and function, as well as the pathological processes driving neurological disorders. Utilizing advanced stem cell-based technologies, including regionalized neural organoids and assembloids, I recreate complex cellular processes—such as axon projection and synaptic formation—within human neural circuits to investigate their assembly during development and their disruption in disease states. By integrating multidimensional molecular approaches, such as scarless CRISPR gene editing and anatomical-to-functional live-cell imaging, my work aims to elucidate disease-associated abnormalities at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and system-wide levels, offering novel insights into human disease.

## Research Contributions
Yuki's research has significantly advanced our understanding of the physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 in central nervous system development, as well as the development of cutting-edge methodologies to model human neural circuits. Key highlights of his contributions include:
1. **Biochemical and Physiological Roles of the small G protein and GTPase activating protein in Neuronal Development**: Yuki elucidated the mechanisms by which the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 modulate neuronal development, particularly neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration (Miura and Hongu et al., Biochemical Journal, 2016; Miura and Kanaho, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 2017).
2. **Reverse Bioengineering Human Neural Circuits**: Yuki has pioneered the development of advanced human neural circuit connectivity and its disruption in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. He developed cortico-striatal assembloids, recapitulating the functional connectivity between the developing cerebral cortex and striatum, which serve as a powerful platform to study neural circuit formation and disease phenotypes using patient-derived cells (Miura et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2020; Miura et al., Nature Protocols, 2022). Building on this work, he introduced thalamo-cortical assembloids, which mimic the developing thalamo-cortical connectivity and have revealed cellular phenotypes associated with CACNA1G channelopathies, advancing our understanding of their contributions to neurological disorders (Kim, Miura, and Li et al., Neuron 2024). Expanding further, Yuki constructed multi-region loop assembloids, integrating cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits to study synchronized neural activity and disease-relevant phenotypes in autism and Tourette syndrome models (Miura and Kim et al., bioRxiv 2024). These innovative platforms collectively provide transformative tools for understanding the assembly and pathology of human neural circuits.
