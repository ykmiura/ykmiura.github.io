title: Research
description: My research focuses on uncovering the mechanisms of human nervous system development and functions, as well as the pathological processes underlying neurological disorders. Using advanced stem cell-based technologies, including neural organoids and assembloids, we recreate complex cellular processes, such as axon projection and synaptic formation within human neural circuits, to understand their assembly during development and disruption in disease states. By integrating molecular approaches such as CRISPR gene editing, live-cell imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics, my recent works aim to elucidate disease-associated abnormalities from cellular to system-wide levels.

## Stem cell-based brain organoid and assembloid technologies
My research centers on pioneering stem cell-based brain organoid and assembloid technologies to model human nervous system development and disease. By engineering region-specific/regionalized neural organoids from human pluripotent stem cells, and integrating them into complex assembloids, we recreate key neural pathways, such as the cortico-basal ganglia neural circuits in vitro. These models allow for the functional study of neuronal connectivity, synaptic development, and disease-associated phenotypes using patient-derived iPS cells and genome-edited lines.

## G protein signaling in health and disease
I have been exploring the critical role of G protein signaling in nervous system development. Using advanced stem cell-based models, we examine the molecular mechanisms underlying G protein-related signaling defects in human nervous system development and functions. Our work integrates CRISPR-mediated gene editing, live-cell imaging, and pharmacological interventions to uncover therapeutic strategies targeting these signaling pathways, seamlessly bridging basic neuroscience with translational medicine.

## Research Contributions
Yuki's research has led to innovative methodologies for modeling human neural circuits. His notable achievements include:
1. Cortico-Striatal Assembloids: Creating in vitro models that mimic the functional connectivity between the cerebral cortex and striatum to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders, published in Nature Biotechnology (2020).
2. Multi-Region Loop Assembloids: Constructing cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop models using custom 3D-printed wells, allowing the study of synchronized neural activity and disease phenotypes, as presented in his recent preprint (bioRxiv, 2024).
3. Disease Modeling: Employing patient-derived or CRISPR-engineered disease model iPS cells to uncover neural circuit abnormalities associated with genetic disorders, such as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, ASH1L-related autism, and Tourette syndrome.
