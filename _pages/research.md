## Research Contributions

Yuki's research has led to innovative methodologies for modeling human neural circuits. His notable achievements include:
1. Cortico-Striatal Assembloids: Creating in vitro models that mimic the functional connectivity between the cerebral cortex and striatum to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders, published in Nature Biotechnology (2020).
2. Multi-Region Loop Assembloids: Constructing cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop models using custom 3D-printed wells, allowing the study of synchronized neural activity and disease phenotypes, as presented in his recent preprint (bioRxiv, 2024).
3. Disease Modeling: Employing patient-derived or CRISPR-engineered disease model iPS cells to uncover neural circuit abnormalities associated with genetic disorders, such as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, ASH1L-related autism, and Tourette syndrome.
