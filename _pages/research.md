description: My research focuses on uncovering the mechanisms of human nervous system development and functions, as well as the pathological processes underlying neurological disorders. Using advanced stem cell-based technologies, including neural organoids and assembloids, we recreate complex cellular processes, such as axon projection and synaptic formation within human neural circuits, to understand their assembly during development and disruption in disease states. By integrating molecular approaches such as CRISPR gene editing, live-cell imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics, my recent works aim to elucidate disease-associated abnormalities from cellular to system-wide levels.

## Research Contributions

Yuki's research has led to innovative methodologies for modeling human neural circuits. His notable achievements include:
1. Cortico-Striatal Assembloids: Creating in vitro models that mimic the functional connectivity between the cerebral cortex and striatum to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders, published in Nature Biotechnology (2020).
2. Multi-Region Loop Assembloids: Constructing cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop models using custom 3D-printed wells, allowing the study of synchronized neural activity and disease phenotypes, as presented in his recent preprint (bioRxiv, 2024).
3. Disease Modeling: Employing patient-derived or CRISPR-engineered disease model iPS cells to uncover neural circuit abnormalities associated with genetic disorders, such as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, ASH1L-related autism, and Tourette syndrome.
