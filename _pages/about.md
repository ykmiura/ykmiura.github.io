title: About
description: Yuki Miura is a neuroscientist with extensive experience in human neural circuit development, stem cell biology, and the modeling of neurodevelopmental disorders. His scientific journey began with a deep curiosity about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain assembly, leading him to pioneer cutting-edge methodologies using stem cell-based brain organoids and assembloids. Over the years, he has honed his expertise to decode the complexities of neural connectivity and its implications for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome.

## Education and Training

Yuki received his Ph.D. in Human Biology from the University of Tsukuba, where he studied the biochemical and physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 in neuronal development. His doctoral research elucidated the molecular mechanisms of neurite morphogenesis and cortical neuron migration, contributing to our understanding of central nervous system development.
Following his Ph.D., Yuki moved to the US and joined Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Dr. Sergiu Pașca. During this time, he developed a series of human stem cell-derived models, including striatal organoids and diencephalic organoids, and integrated these into assembloids to study long-range neural circuit connections. These models have been instrumental in identifying cellular and circuit-level phenotypes in patient-derived cells, as well as CRISPR-engineered disease model cells.

## Research Contributions

Yuki's research has led to innovative methodologies for modeling human neural circuits. His notable achievements include:
1. Cortico-Striatal Assembloids: Creating in vitro models that mimic the functional connectivity between the cerebral cortex and striatum to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders, published in Nature Biotechnology (2020).
2. Multi-Region Loop Assembloids: Constructing cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop models using custom 3D-printed wells, allowing the study of synchronized neural activity and disease phenotypes, as presented in his recent preprint (bioRxiv, 2024).
3. Disease Modeling: Employing patient-derived or CRISPR-engineered disease model iPS cells to uncover neural circuit abnormalities associated with genetic disorders, such as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, ASH1L-related autism, and Tourette syndrome.
