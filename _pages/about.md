title: About
description: Yuki Miura is a neuroscientist with extensive experience in human neural circuit development, stem cell biology, and the modeling of neurodevelopmental disorders. His scientific journey began with a deep curiosity about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain assembly, leading him to pioneer cutting-edge methodologies using stem cell-based brain organoids and assembloids. Over the years, he has honed his expertise to decode the complexities of neural connectivity and its implications for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome.

## Education and Training

Yuki earned his Ph.D. in Human Biology from the University of Tsukuba under the mentorship of Dr. Yasunori Kanaho. His doctoral research focused on the biochemical and physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 in neuronal development. Through this work, he elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying neurite morphogenesis and cortical neuron migration, significantly advancing our understanding of central nervous system development.
Following his Ph.D., Yuki joined Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Dr. Sergiu Pașca. At Stanford, he pioneered the development of human stem cell-derived models, including striatal and diencephalic organoids, and their integration into assembloids to investigate long-range neural circuit connectivity. These innovative models have been instrumental in uncovering cellular and circuit-level phenotypes in patient-derived cells and CRISPR-engineered disease models, shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Research Contributions

Yuki's research has significantly advanced our understanding of the physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 in central nervous system development, as well as the development of cutting-edge methodologies to model human neural circuits. Key highlights of his contributions include:
1. Biochemical and Physiological Roles of Arf6 and ACAP3 in Neuronal Development: Yuki elucidated the mechanisms by which the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 modulate neuronal development, particularly neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration (Miura and Hongu et al., Biochemical Journal, 2016; Miura and Kanaho, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 2017).
2. Cortico-Striatal Assembloids: Yuki pioneered the creation of in vitro models that mimic the functional connectivity between the cerebral cortex and striatum, providing a platform to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders. These models demonstrated synaptic connectivity and disease phenotypes using patient-derived cells (Miura et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2020; Miura et al., Nature Protocols, 2022).
3. Thalamo-cortical Assembloids: By developing models of thalamo-cortical connectivity, Yuki uncovered cellular phenotypes associated with CACNA1G channelopathies, contributing to our understanding of their role in neuropsychiatric disorders (Kim, Miura, and Li et al., Neuron 2024)
4. Multi-Region Loop Assembloids: Constructing cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical loop models using custom 3D-printed wells, allowing the study of synchronized neural activity and disease phenotypes (Miura and Kim et al., bioRxiv 2024).
