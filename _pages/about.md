title: About
description: Yuki Miura is a neuroscientist with extensive experience in human neural circuit development, stem cell biology, and the modeling of neurodevelopmental disorders. His scientific journey began with a deep curiosity about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain assembly, leading him to pioneer cutting-edge methodologies using stem cell-based brain organoids and assembloids. Over the years, he has honed his expertise to decode the complexities of neural connectivity and its implications for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome.

## Education and Training

Yuki earned his Ph.D. in Human Biology from the University of Tsukuba under the mentorship of Dr. Yasunori Kanaho. His doctoral research focused on the biochemical and physiological roles of the small G protein Arf6 and its regulator ACAP3 in neuronal development. Through this work, he elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying neurite morphogenesis and cortical neuron migration, significantly advancing our understanding of central nervous system development.
Following his Ph.D., Yuki joined Stanford University as a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Dr. Sergiu Pașca. At Stanford, he pioneered the development of human stem cell-derived models, including striatal and diencephalic organoids, and their integration into assembloids to investigate long-range neural circuit connectivity. These innovative models have been instrumental in uncovering cellular and circuit-level phenotypes in patient-derived cells and CRISPR-engineered disease models, shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.
